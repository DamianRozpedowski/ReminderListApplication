## 1. Introduction

An Android application that allows users to manage and keep track of reminders that have been set. Reminders can be set for a specific date and time, or for a specific location.

---
## 2. Process Description

### D1 - Software Design

#### Activity Description

Fully understanding the requirements and using that understanding to build a baseline, UML class diagrams that will show the structure of the application. Combining different interpretations and perspectives of the requirements and critiquing each UML design such that only the best portions of the designs are combined into the final diagram.

#### Entrance Criteria

* Application requirements, features, and operations

#### Exit Criteria

* Individual designs from each teammate
* Combined group design incorporating all benefits from each individual design

---

### D2 - Inception & Elaboration

#### Activity Description

Preparing documentation to incorporate finer details of the application design. This allows us to have a more complete understanding of the application and also allows for future reference and updates in the event that new insights arrive. It also allows us to keep track of our process and that we are aligning with this documentation during the implementation phase or make changes accordingly.

#### Entrance Criteria

* Completion of software design
* Guidelines for the required documents

#### Exit Criteria

* Creation of all the required documents
* Preliminary designs of the component diagram, deployment diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram, use case diagram
* Establish a design model that can help us determine the resources needed and generate a plan to implement the application's requirements

---

### D3 - Construction

#### Activity Description

Constructing an initial build of the application while following our documentation. While creating the application, there will be problems that come from it and in order to continue we should adjust the documentation to fit our new understanding of the requirements or change the way we are coding in order to have a seamless transition from documentation to code. Testing provides a crucial role here as bugs and implementation issues found here while the program is not as complex can prove beneficial in the future. Furthermore a new user manual will be released in order to facilitate ease of entry for our program.

#### Entrance Criteria

* Flexible and proper documentation created during the Inception & Elaboration phase
* Thorough amount of test cases that covers not only the functionalities of the application but also the database and API dependencies of the application

#### Exit Criteria

* A functional application satisfying all the requirements
* A live database
* Updated documentation that coincides with the current state of the application

---

### D4 - Transition

#### Activity Description

In order to wrap up the development phase of the application we should fix as many bugs as possible and document the changes and how they were fixed. Complete all of our test cases and show that the results are satisfactory. Finally in order to have a complete transition, updates should be applied to all documents that do not align with the final version of the application.

#### Entrance Criteria

* A preliminary software application that allows users to manage and keep track of reminders 
* Test results from the Construction phase
* Documentation that accurately aligns with the current application version

#### Exit Criteria

* A complete software application that allows users to manage and keep track of reminders 
* Completed test results
* Fix all outstanding bugs
* Finalized documentation that correctly matches the current application version
